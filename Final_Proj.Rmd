## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# read in data
both_sexes_df <- read.csv("./data/both_sexes.csv")
divorce_df <- read.csv("./data/divorce.csv")
men_df <- read.csv("./data/men.csv")
women_df <- read.csv("./data/women.csv")
```

```{r}
# Filter men.csv
both_sexes_edu_filt_df <- both_sexes_df[, c("year", "HS_2534", 
                                            "SC_2534", "BAp_2534")]
both_sexes_edu_filt_df$HS_2534 <- 1- both_sexes_edu_filt_df$HS_2534 
both_sexes_edu_filt_df$SC_2534 <- 1- both_sexes_edu_filt_df$SC_2534 
both_sexes_edu_filt_df$BAp_2534 <- 1- both_sexes_edu_filt_df$BAp_2534 

both_sexes_race_eth_filt_df <- both_sexes_df[, c("year", "White_2534", 
                                                 "Black_2534", "Hisp_2534")]
both_sexes_race_eth_filt_df$White_2534 <- 1- both_sexes_race_eth_filt_df$White_2534 
both_sexes_race_eth_filt_df$Black_2534 <- 1- both_sexes_race_eth_filt_df$Black_2534

```
